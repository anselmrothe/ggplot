# Plotting in R with ggplot

## Getting started

### I haven't used R yet. How do I start?
To program in R, I like to work with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

### Ok, I installed RStudio. How can I use ggplot?
Install it by executing this line in RStudio (yes, it's actually ggplot2 we are talking about, the original ggplot is outdated):

`install.packages("ggplot2")`

You only need to install it once. But you need to activate it whenever you start a session with this:

`library(ggplot2)`

## Simple examples

### Most simple

`...`

## Full cycle
1. Load data
2. [Reshape data](2-reshape_data.md)
3. Plot data

### Example
`...`

## Resources
(Subjective selection)

If I get stuck with a ggplot problem, I often just use google (for example "ggplot change order of colors"). Usually very efficient; leads you often to helpful answers on stackoverflow ([example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15251816/how-do-you-order-the-fill-colours-within-ggplot2-geom-bar)).
