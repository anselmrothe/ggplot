# Plotting in R with ggplot

## Getting started

### I haven't used R yet. How do I start?
To program in R, I like to work with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

### Ok, I installed RStudio. How can I use ggplot?
Install it by executing this line in RStudio (yes, it's actually ggplot2 we are talking about, the original ggplot is outdated):

`install.packages("ggplot2")`

You only need to install it once. But you need to activate it whenever you start a session with this:

`library(ggplot2)`

## Simple examples

### Most simple

`...`

## Full cycle
1. Load data
